# Subspace Estimation with Automatic Dimension and Variable Selection (SEAS) algorithm

This folder contains three folders:
- simulation_p1000: reproduce results in Table 1 with p = 1000.
- simulation_p3000: reproduce results in Table 1 with p = 3000.
- real_data_analysis: reproduces the results in the real data analysis in Section 6.
