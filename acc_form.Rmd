## Abstract

<!--
Provide a short (< 100 words), high-level description of the data
-->
In Section 6, we considered the lymphoma data set available from R package **spls**. It consists of 42 samples of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 9 samples of follicular lymphoma (FL), and 11 samples of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), coded as $Y$= 0, 1, and 2, respectively. And $p = 4026$ gene expression measurements are recorded as the predictor $X$.

## Availability


- [x] Data **are** publicly available.
- [ ] Data **cannot be made** publicly available.

If the data are publicly available, see the *Publicly available data* section. Otherwise, see the *Non-publicly available data* section, below.

### Publicly available data

- [x] Data are available online at: The data is available from R package **spls**.

- [ ] Data are available as part of the paperâ€™s supplementary material.

- [ ] Data are publicly available by request, following the process described here:

- [ ] Data are or will be made available through some other mechanism, described here:


<!-- If data are available by request to the authors or some other data owner, please make sure to explain the process of requesting access to the data. -->

### Non-publicly available data

<!--
The Journal of the American Statistical Association requires authors to make data accompanying their papers available to the scientific community except in cases where: 1) public sharing of data would be impossible, 2) suitable synthetic data are provided which allow the main analyses to be replicated (recognizing that results may differ from the "real" data analyses), and 3) the scientific value of the results and methods outweigh the lack of reproducibility.

Please discuss the lack of publicly available data. For example:
-	why data sharing is not possible,
-	what synthetic data are provided, and 
-	why the value of the paper's scientific contribution outweighs the lack of reproducibility.

## Abstract

<!--

Each folder reproduces the results in simulation studies (Section 5) or real data analysis (Section 6).

## Description
All statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.0.0. Each folder is described as follows:

1. *simulation_p1000*, *simulation_p3000*:  reproduce results in Table 1 with $p = 1000$ and $p = 3000$. The output is saved to the folder *output*. Please refer to Section **Workflow** for details.
  - *simulationX_dat.R*: simulates data in model X.
  - *simulationX_LassoSIR.R*: implements LassoSIR in model X.
  - *simulationX.R*: implements SEAS-SIR, SEAS-Intra, and SEAS-PFC in models 1-4, and implements Lasso in models 1-2.
2. *real_data_analysis*: reproduces the results in the real data analysis.
  - *lymphoma_est.R*: reproduces the Estimation part (columns 2--5) in Table 2.
  - *lymphoma_pred.R*: reproduces the Classification error part (columns 6--9) in Table 2.
  - *plot_lymphoma.R*: reproduces Figure 1.
  
The common R files contained in all these folders are described as follows:

- *seas.R*: SEAS algorithm (Algorithm 1)
- *utility.R*: auxiliary functions.
- *LassoSIR_revised.R*: We revise the 'LassoSIR' function from R package 'LassoSIR'. The revised function accepts the user-specified cross-validation folds index and the user-specified tuning parameter sequence and records the computation time.

### Instructions

<!--
Describe how to use the materials provided to reproduce analyses in the manuscript. Additional details can be provided in file(s) accompanying the reproducibility materials. If no workflow is provided, please state this and say why (e.g., if the paper contains no computational work).
-->
- The folders *simulation_p1000* and *simulation_p3000* reproduce the results in Table 1. Since their workflows are similar, we use *simulation_p1000* as an example. We show how to generate the results in model (M1) with $p = 1000$. First, we run file *simulation1_dat.R* to randomly generate the basis matrix $\beta$ (saved to the folder *beta*), the cross-validation folds index (saved to the folder *dat*), and the data replicates (saved to the folder *dat*). Then we run files *simulation1_LassoSIR.R* and *simulation1.R* to generate all comparison criteria for each method. The results are saved to the folder *output*.

- For the folder *real_data_analysis*, run *lymphoma_pred.R* and *lymphoma_est.R* to reproduce the results in Table 2. Run *plot_lymphoma.R* to reproduce Figures 1.

### Expected run-time

Approximate time needed to reproduce the analyses on a standard desktop machine:

- [ ] < 1 minute
- [ ] 1-10 minutes
- [ ] 10-60 minutes
- [ ] 1-8 hours
- [x] > 8 hours
- [ ] Not feasible to run on a desktop machine, as described here:

### Additional information (optional)

<!--
OPTIONAL: Additional documentation provided (e.g., R package vignettes, demos or other examples) that show how to use the provided code/software in other settings.
-->
In our numerical studies, we include natural SSIR and refined SSIR (Tan et al., 2020) as competitors. However, since the authors' codes are not open to the public, we do not include the implementation of these two competitors in our reproducible materials. The codes may be requested from the authors.
